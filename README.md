# Kevin Heise Individual Project

This repository is for my Indie Project.

### Problem Statement

What if there was only one place you had to go to view upcoming concerts in your area, based on your musical tastes? [ProjectName] will do just that. [ProjectName] will aslo keep track of any previous shows that you've attended, making it easy to view photos to remind you of the great times you had.

Sometimes it can be difficult making plans with others. [ProjectName] will also allow you to see who else in your area will be attending the show you want to go to, and if they are interested in carpooling. This way, you'll never have to worry about missing a concert because you had nobody to go with.
